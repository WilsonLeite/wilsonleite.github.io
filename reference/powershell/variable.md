# PowerShell - Variables

## Variables

variables are loosely typed

cast notation: Defines the variable type so values will always be converted to that (or fail)


``` PowerShell
[int]$number = 8
$number = "12345"  # The string is converted to an integer.
$number = "Hello"  # Fail
```
