## Describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud

Availability is related to resources available to be used by the production systems. It is measured by the proportion of time the system is running (uptime).

High Availability is achieved by architectural choices made to mitigate or decrease the downtime of the cloud resources. It is achieved by resource redundancy and the committed level of service is described by a SLAs.
 
Scalability
* Ability to adjust resources to meet demand
* It allows minimizing the allocation of resources not used, saving costs.
* Vertical (scale up, more powerful resources)
* Horizontal (scale out, more units of resources)
