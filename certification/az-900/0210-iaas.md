## Describe infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

In this model, the customer rents virtualized hardware infrastructure like servers,  network, storage, etc. and has total control on how it is used. The cloud provider takes care of the physical hardware, power, cooling, networking - including access to the Internet - and physical security. The virtual servers come with a pre-defined operating system image but the customer is responsible for installing updates and security patches.

Examples of IaaS resources:
* Virtual Machine
* Block Storage (virtual HD/SSD)
* Network Router
