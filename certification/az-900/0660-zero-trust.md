## Describe the concept of Zero Trust

Zero Trust is a security model that does not assume that a request is secure just because it originated from a secure perimeter (network, etc.) or a trusted computer. Instead of assuming that a device is safe because itâ€™s within the corporate network, it requires everyone to authenticate. Then grants access based on authentication rather than location.

It's implementation is based on these guiding principles:

* Verify explicitly - Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.
* Use least privilege access - Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.
* Assume breach - Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption. Use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.
