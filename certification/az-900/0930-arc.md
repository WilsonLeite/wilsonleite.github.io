# Describe the purpose of Azure Arc

Azure Arc allows extending Azure Resource Manager (ARM) features to non-Azure resources, as those running on-premises or in other cloud providers. These features include policies (and governance), Role-Based Access Control, Tags, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, etc.

Currently, Azure Arc allows you to manage the following resource types hosted outside of Azure:

* Servers: Policies, patches, monitoring
* Kubernetes clusters
* Azure data services
* SQL Server
* Virtual machines (preview): Provisioning and management of Virtual Machines
