# Describe cost management capabilities in Azure

## Cost Management tool

Cost Management provides the ability to quickly check Azure resource costs, create alerts based on resource spend, and create budgets that can be used to automate management of resources.

Cost analysis is a subset of Cost Management that provides a quick visual for your Azure costs. Using cost analysis, it is possible to quickly view the total cost in a variety of different ways, including by billing cycle, region, resource, and so on. It is possible to see accumulated costs over time to estimate monthly, quarterly, or even yearly cost trends against a budget.

### Budgets

A budget is where a spending limit is set. Budgets can be set based on a subscription, resource group, service type, or other criteria and have an associated budget alert. These alerts as shown in the Cost Alerts area and may be configured to send an e-mail notification or trigger automations meant to act on the resources over budget.

### Cost Alerts

* Budget Alerts: Triggered when the cost or consumption met the alert conditions.
* Credit Alerts: Triggered under Enterprise Agreement subscriptions when the cost reaches 90% and 100% of the credit.
* Quota Alerts: Under Enterprise Agreement subscriptions, spending quotas can be configured as well as the threshold that triggers the alert.
