## Compare compute types, including containers, virtual machines, and functions

Virtual Machines: Abstraction of a physical computer
* Total control over the operating system (OS)
* The ability to run custom software
* To use custom hosting configurations

Containers: Abstraction of an operation system
* Lightweight
* No need to manage the operating system

Functions
* Event-driven
* Runs on demand
* Easily scalable
* Doesnâ€™t require maintaining virtual machines or containers
