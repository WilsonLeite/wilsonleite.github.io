## Compare compute types, including containers, virtual machines, and functions

Virtual Machines: Abstraction of a physical computer
* Total control over the operating system (OS)
* Ability to run custom software
* Ability to use custom hosting configurations

Containers: Abstraction of an operation system
* Lightweight
* No need to manage the operating system

Functions
* Event-driven
* Runs on demand
* Easily scalable
* Doesn’t require maintaining virtual machines or containers
* A failure in an instance does not affect other instances

<< Reserved instances? >>
