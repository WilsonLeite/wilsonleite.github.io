## Describe virtual machine options, including Azure virtual machines, Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets, availability sets, and Azure Virtual Desktop

Azure virtual machines
* Abstraction of a physical computer
* Created based on a pre-defined image containing the Operating System and, optionally, additional software

<< How to create a custom image? >>

Scale sets
* Group of identical, load-balanced VMs
* Allow to centrally manage, configure, and update a large number of VMs
* number of instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or based on a defined schedule
* Includes a load balancer

Availability sets 

Groups VMs by:
* Update domain: 
    * VMs that can be rebooted at the same time
    * Gives 30-minute time to recover 
* Fault domain
    * Power source and network switch
    * By default, an availability set will split the VMs across up to three fault domains

<< Is it independent of Scale sets? >>
<< How the update process is started? >>

Virtual Desktop

* Windows 10 or Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session
* Desktop and application virtualization service that runs on the cloud
* Centralized security management
* Clients for Windows, Mac, Android, and even browser.
