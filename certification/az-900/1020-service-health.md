## Describe Azure Service Health

Azure Service Health is composed by three services:

* _Azure Status_: Public page with the overall status of Azure services around the world.
* _Service Health_: Detailed view of Azure services matching the ones used by the current Tenant. For example, Network status of the _US Central_ region.
* _Resource Health_: Detailed view of the health of specific resources used by the current Tenant. For example VM using 100% of CPU.

It is possible to setup alerts and historical alerts are stored and accessible for later review.
