## Describe Azure resources and resource groups

Resources are the individual pieces of infrastructure that can be provisioned in Azure. Every resource created must be associated with exactly one resource Group and some resources can be moved from a Resource Group to another.

A Resource Group can contain from zero to many resources. Resource Groups cannot be nested. Actions applied to a Resource Group apply to all resources inside of it. For example, when granting or denying access of even deleting the Resource Group.

How resources are organized in Resource Groups is up to the customer.
