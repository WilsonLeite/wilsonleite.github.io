## Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud model

Private:
* Organizations have complete control over resources and security
* Data is not collocated with other organizations’ data

Public:
* No capital expenditures to scale up
* Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned
* Organizations pay only for what they use

Hybrid:
* Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements
