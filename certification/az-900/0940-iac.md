## Describe infrastructure as code (IaC)

Infrastructure as code is a concept where the management of resources is done by automation, in contrast of doing it manually using the Azure Portal.

The basic implementation of this concept is done by writing scripts using Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell that create the infrastructure by running the commands one by one.

An advanced implementation uses _desired-state_ tools like ARM Templates, where the desired infrastructure is described and the tool translates that design into Azure Resource Manager API calls.
