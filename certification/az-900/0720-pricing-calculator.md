## Compare the pricing calculator and the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator

The pricing calculator is designed to provide an estimated cost for provisioning resources. It provides a detailed estimate for each resource as well as the total cost. The prices may be preesented per hour or per month.

The TCO Calculator is meant to compare the cost of resources in Azure equivalent to the ones present in an on-premises datacenter. The input has a lower granularity, like _x_ Windows Servers and _y_ SQL Server databases. It also accepts other costs, like labor, electricity, etc. The final report is a comparison in a given period of time - by default, 5 years - of cumulative costs in both scenarios.
